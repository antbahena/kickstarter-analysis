# Kickstarting Data Analysis

## Overview of Project
 
### Purpose
An Analysis of Kick starter campaings and to see which pledges were succesful.
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis shows that plays tend to be more succesful when kept in the less than 1000 range to 49999 anything more and you start having issues. Some of the challenges met was in created the countif formulas as it was chalenging to capture the correct columns.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May seems to be the most succesful month to launch theater related campaigns. Theater launches seem to rarely be cancelled as the data is non existant in the month of October.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Goals tend to be met more often when kept under 5000 which is not to say it wont be succesful but the success rate does rise to over 70%
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenge was in making sure that data was captured correctly and keeping everything organized. The Count if formula and graphs presented their own challenged since they require precise details to be accurate.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May seems to be the most succesful month to launch theater related campaigns. Theater launches seem to rarely be cancelled as the data is non existant in the month of October.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Goals tend to be met more often when kept under 5000 which is not to say it wont be succesful but the success rate does rise to over 70%
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set is limited that it does not show enough information on attendance as it is purely pledge based.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a line chart showing each subject and which tends to be more succesful at which goals. We can also see if certain subjects are more succesful at higher amounts than others.
